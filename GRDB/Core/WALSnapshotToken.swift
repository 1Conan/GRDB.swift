/// A token that indicates which WAL snapshot is being accessed.
///
/// ## Overview
///
/// - note: [**ðŸ”¥ EXPERIMENTAL**](https://github.com/groue/GRDB.swift/blob/master/README.md#what-are-experimental-features)
///
/// All database accesses performed from a `WALSnapshotToken` see the database
/// content as it existed at the moment the token was created.
///
/// ## Usage
///
/// You create a `WALSnapshotToken` from a ``DatabasePool``,
/// with ``DatabasePool/currentSnapshotToken()``:
///
/// ```swift
/// let dbPool = try DatabasePool(path: "/path/to/database.sqlite")
/// let token = try dbPool.currentSnapshotToken()
/// let playerCount = try dbPool.read(from: token) { db in
///     try Player.fetchCount(db)
/// }
/// ```
///
/// When you want to control the database state seen by a token, create the
/// token from within a write access, outside of any transaction.
///
/// For example, compare the two tokens below. The first one is guaranteed to
/// see an empty table of players, because is is created after all players have
/// been deleted, and from the serialized writer dispatch queue which prevents
/// any concurrent write. The second is created without this concurrency
/// protection, which means that some other threads may already have created
/// some players:
///
/// ```swift
/// let token1 = try dbPool.writeWithoutTransaction { db -> WALSnapshotToken in
///     try db.inTransaction {
///         try Player.deleteAll()
///         return .commit
///     }
///
///     return dbPool.currentSnapshotToken()
/// }
///
/// // <- Other threads may have created some players here
/// let token2 = try dbPool.currentSnapshotToken()
///
/// // Guaranteed to be zero
/// let count1 = try dbPool.read(from: token1, Player.fetchCount)
///
/// // Could be anything
/// let count2 = try dbPool.read(from: token2, Player.fetchCount)
/// ```
///
