/// A database connection that allows concurrent accesses to an unchanging
/// database content, as it existed at the moment the snapshot was created.
///
/// ## Overview
///
/// - note: [**ðŸ”¥ EXPERIMENTAL**](https://github.com/groue/GRDB.swift/blob/master/README.md#what-are-experimental-features)
///
/// A `DatabaseSnapshotPool` never sees any database modification during all its
/// lifetime. All database accesses performed from a snapshot always see the
/// same identical database content.
///
/// A `DatabaseSnapshotPool` instance shares the same pool of reader SQLite
/// connections as a ``DatabasePool``. It requires an SQLite database in the
/// [WAL mode](https://www.sqlite.org/wal.html).
///
/// ## Usage
///
/// You create a `DatabaseSnapshotPool` from a ``DatabasePool``,
/// with ``DatabasePool/makeSnapshotPool()``:
///
/// ```swift
/// let dbPool = try DatabasePool(path: "/path/to/database.sqlite")
/// let snapshot = try dbPool.makeSnapshotPool()
/// let playerCount = try snapshot.read { db in
///     try Player.fetchCount(db)
/// }
/// ```
///
/// When you want to control the database state seen by a snapshot, create the
/// snapshot from within a write access, outside of any transaction.
///
/// For example, compare the two snapshots below. The first one is guaranteed to
/// see an empty table of players, because is is created after all players have
/// been deleted, and from the serialized writer dispatch queue which prevents
/// any concurrent write. The second is created without this concurrency
/// protection, which means that some other threads may already have created
/// some players:
///
/// ```swift
/// let snapshot1 = try dbPool.writeWithoutTransaction { db -> DatabaseSnapshot in
///     try db.inTransaction {
///         try Player.deleteAll()
///         return .commit
///     }
///
///     return dbPool.makeSnapshotPool()
/// }
///
/// // <- Other threads may have created some players here
/// let snapshot2 = try dbPool.makeSnapshotPool()
///
/// // Guaranteed to be zero
/// let count1 = try snapshot1.read(Player.fetchCount)
///
/// // Could be anything
/// let count2 = try snapshot2.read(Player.fetchCount)
/// ```
///
/// `DatabaseSnapshotPool` inherits its database access methods from the
/// ``DatabaseReader`` protocols.
///
/// Related SQLite documentation:
///
/// - <https://www.sqlite.org/c3ref/snapshot_get.html>
/// - <https://www.sqlite.org/c3ref/snapshot_open.html>
