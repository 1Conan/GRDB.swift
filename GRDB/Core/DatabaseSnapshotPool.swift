// Sharing connections with DatabasePool creates a problem with reentrant access.
// If we create a new pool of connections, we avoid this problem. And we can
// simplify the management of shared cache (drop all cache-merging code)

/// A database connection that allows concurrent accesses to an unchanging
/// database content, as it existed at the moment the snapshot was created.
///
/// ## Overview
///
/// - note: [**ðŸ”¥ EXPERIMENTAL**](https://github.com/groue/GRDB.swift/blob/master/README.md#what-are-experimental-features)
///
/// A `DatabaseSnapshotPool` never sees any database modification during all its
/// lifetime. All database accesses performed from a snapshot always see the
/// same identical database content.
///
/// It creates a pool of up to ``Configuration/maximumReaderCount`` read-only
/// SQLite connections. All read accesses are executed in **reader dispatch
/// queues** (one per read-only SQLite connection). SQLite connections are
/// closed when the `DatabasePool` is deallocated.
///
/// An SQLite database in the [WAL mode](https://www.sqlite.org/wal.html) is
/// required for creating a `DatabaseSnapshotPool`.
///
/// ## Usage
///
/// You create a `DatabaseSnapshotPool` from a
/// [WAL mode](https://www.sqlite.org/wal.html) database, such as databases
/// created from a ``DatabasePool``:
///
/// ```swift
/// let dbPool = try DatabasePool(path: "/path/to/database.sqlite")
/// let snapshot = try dbPool.makeSnapshotPool()
/// let playerCount = try snapshot.read { db in
///     try Player.fetchCount(db)
/// }
/// ```
///
/// When you want to control the database state seen by a snapshot, create the
/// snapshot from within a write access, outside of any transaction.
///
/// For example, compare the two snapshots below. The first one is guaranteed to
/// see an empty table of players, because is is created after all players have
/// been deleted, and from the serialized writer dispatch queue which prevents
/// any concurrent write. The second is created without this concurrency
/// protection, which means that some other threads may already have created
/// some players:
///
/// ```swift
/// let snapshot1 = try dbPool.writeWithoutTransaction { db -> DatabaseSnapshotPool in
///     try db.inTransaction {
///         try Player.deleteAll()
///         return .commit
///     }
///
///     return try dbPool.makeSnapshotPool()
///     // OR (this is equivalent)
///     return try DatabaseSnapshotPool(db)
/// }
///
/// // <- Other threads may have created some players here
/// let snapshot2 = try dbPool.makeSnapshotPool()
///
/// // Guaranteed to be zero
/// let count1 = try snapshot1.read(Player.fetchCount)
///
/// // Could be anything
/// let count2 = try snapshot2.read(Player.fetchCount)
/// ```
///
/// `DatabaseSnapshotPool` inherits its database access methods from the
/// ``DatabaseReader`` protocols.
///
